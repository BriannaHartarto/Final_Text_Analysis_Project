# Final Project
Entitled "The 2024 Pro-Palestinian Campus Protests: A TF-IDF Analysis of Coverage in Student-Run vs. National News Publications," this project utilizes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency analysis to compare how student-run publications and national news outlets covered the 2024 campus protests in the context of the Israel-Hamas War. To conduct the analysis, I took a random sample of 20 articles published on the protests from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Daily Trojan, and Harvard Crimson. I collected articles from April 15 to May 15, 2024, a timeframe which covers the establishment and dismantling of the pro-Palestine campus encampments and excluded opinion pieces. I visualized the top 20 TF-IDF terms for each publication using bar charts. Ultimately, I grouped articles from each publication type and visualized the top 20 words using bar charts.
